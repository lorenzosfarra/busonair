== NEO4J ==
neo4j/conf/neo4j-wrapper.conf: maximum heap size incremented to 1024MB

Not touched by interesting property is the org.neo4j.server.transaction.timeout=60, against orphaned transactions.

== LOAD IN RAM ==
$SERVER_URL/init/loadinram loads all the elements in RAM. The "user-friendly" version is $SERVER_URL/init that simply performs an AJAX call to /loadinram showing some stats to the user.
IMPORTANT: Should be called only once at start-time from an administrator.

== MOST IMPORTANT REAL-TIME APIs ==
/runs/{id}/rt/updateposition?time={time}&lat={lat}&lon={lon}
/runs/{id}/rt/getlastgpscheckpoint
/runs/{id}/rt/getlastgpsposition

== TRACKER CONFIGURATION ==
The password is the default one: 123456.
Send an SMS for each of the following statements to the tracker SIM number:

begin+123456
apn+123456+ +$APN_here
adminip+123456+ +$UDPServer_IP_here+ +port
t030s005n+123456

The previous configuration sets the APN, the UDP server:port destination and the repetition period.

The tracker will send the following message to the UDP Server:
{lat: X.X long: Y.Y speed: Z dd/MM/yy hh:mm bat:F signal:F imei:xyz}

The UDP Server is in the UDPServer/ directory.

== COMMAND LINE UTILS ==
Different utils are available in the commandline_utils directory.

== DISKS ==
I have created a new disk, so now there are 2 disks in the machine. The second one is completely dedicated to the neo4j data.
