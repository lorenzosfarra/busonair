neo4j-backup — Neo4j Backup Tool

Synopsis

neo4j-backup {-full|-incremental} -from SourceURI -to Directory
[-cluster ClusterName]

DESCRIPTION

A tool to perform live backups over the network from a running Neo4j
graph database onto a local filesystem. Backups can be either full or
incremental. The first backup must be a full backup, after that
incremental backups can be performed.

The source(s) are given as URIs in a special format, the target is a
filesystem location.

BACKUP TYPE

-full
    copies the entire database to a directory.
-incremental
    copies the changes that have taken place since the last full or
    incremental backup to an existing backup store.

SOURCE URI

Backup sources are given in the following format:

<running mode>://<host>[:<port>][,<host>[:<port>]]…

Note that multiple hosts can be defined.

running mode
    'single' or 'ha'. 'ha' is for instances in High Availability
    mode, 'single' is for standalone databases.
host
    In single mode, the host of a source database; in ha mode, the
    host of a coordinator instance. Note that multiple hosts can be
    given when using High Availability mode.
port
    In single mode, the port of a source database backup service; in
    ha mode, the port of a coordinator instance backup service. If
    not given, the default value 6362 will be used.

CLUSTER NAME

-cluster
    If you have specified a cluster name for your High Availability
    cluster, you need to specify it when doing backups. Add the
    config parameter: -cluster my_custom_cluster_name

IMPORTANT

Backups can only be performed on databases which have the
configuration parameter enable_online_backup=true set. That will make
the backup service available on the default port (6362). To enable
the backup service on a different port use for example 
enable_online_backup=port=9999 instead.

Usage - Windows

The Neo4jBackup.bat script is used in the same way.

EXAMPLES

# Performing a full backup
neo4j-backup -full -from single://192.168.1.34 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup
neo4j-backup -incremental -from single://freja -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup where the service is registered on a custom port
neo4j-backup -incremental -from single://freja:9999 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing a full backup from HA cluster, specifying two possible coordinators
./neo4j-backup -full -from ha://oden:2181,loke:2181 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup from HA cluster, specifying only one coordinator
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from ha://oden:2181 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup

# Performing an incremental backup from HA cluster with a specific name
# (specified by neo4j configuration 'ha.cluster_name')
./neo4j-backup -incremental -from ha://balder:2181 -to /mnt/backup/neo4j-backup -cluster my-cluster

RESTORE FROM BACKUP

The Neo4j backups are fully functional databases. To use a backup,
replace your database directory with the backup.
